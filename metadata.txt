about=This plugin serves as support of foresters in the design of forest roads. Taking as input a digital terrain model (raster dtm) and a starting polyline or Point layer (whose nodes/points indicates the starting point, end point and the waypoints of the road to be designed), another polyline is produced that meets a series of design requirements established by the user (longitudinal slope among others). This plugin allows user to generate a longitudinal terrain profile of the road designed. The funcionality of the plugin is inspired in the ESRI Arcview Extension PEGGER (http://www.ruraltech.org/tools/pegger/). This plugin has been funded by the Direcci√≥n General de Medio Natural del Gobierno de La Rioja and developed by PANOimagen S.L.
