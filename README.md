This plugin serves as support of foresters in the design of forest roads. Taking as input a digital terrain model (raster dtm) and a starting polyline with the desired route to design (batch/automatic processing mode), or interactively through the addition of points by the user (interactive processing mode), the plugin generates another polyline that meets a series of design requirements established by the user (longitudinal slope among others). 

The funcionality of the plugin is inspired in the _ESRI Arcview Extension PEGGER_ _(<http://www.ruraltech.org/tools/pegger/>)_. 

User also can define some areas to exclude of the forest road design, with a polygon layer. The user can also see the longitudinal profile of the designed road, for this it is recommended to use Profile tool plugin _(<https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/profiletool/>)_. 

This plugin has been funded by the Dirección General de Tecnologías de la Información y la Comunicación del Gobierno de La Rioja and developed by PANOimagen S.L. at the request of the Dirección General de Medio Natural del Gobierno de La Rioja.
