This classes implement dynamic (i.e. path dependent) and static (i.e.
pixel dependent) penalization factors for a given route.

NoPenalty always returns 0 (i.e. no penalties at all)

ExclusionPenalty returns 0 (i.e. no penalties at all)

ParabolicPenalty implements dynamic penalization in the xy and z planes,
